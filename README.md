# Hikvsion intercom to MQTT bridge.

This will connect to your intercom and send events to mqtt.

Probably works with all Hikvision video intercoms, like: 
 * DS-KD8003
 * DS-KV8113
 * DS-KV8213
 * DS-KV6113
 * DS-KV8413

Since it uses the official SDK it doesnt require custom firmware or other special things.

Edit config.py and see what happens. :)

TODO: all opening door via mqtt as well. (i dont need it myself yet)

Based off the excellent example from: https://github.com/laszlojakab/hikvision-intercom-python-demo
